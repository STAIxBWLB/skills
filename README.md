# Maru Bundled Skills

Skills bundle embedded by Maru. This directory is the T1 core source for
skills that must ship with the desktop app. Public/private extension skills
belong in the Maru source checkouts under `~/.maru/skills/_sources/`.

## Layout

```
skills/<name>/SKILL.md     Maru-bundled T1 skill packages
envs/default/              shared Python/Node runtime scaffold
lib/build-graph.py         shared graph builder
lib/vault_adapter.md       Obsidian MCP vault access rules
docs/                      shared reference catalogs
manifest.json              Maru-compatible skills manifest
```

There is no category subdirectory split or legacy helper directory split in
this bundle.

## Runtime Federation

Maru materializes this bundle into `~/.maru/skills/_builtin`, records it in
`~/.maru/skills/registry.json`, and installs user-facing skill entrypoints as
symlinks:

```text
~/.maru/skills/<name> -> ~/.maru/skills/_builtin/skills/<name>
~/.claude/skills/<name> -> ~/.maru/skills/<name>
```

Do not install these packages by copying files manually. Use Maru's Skills UI
or `skill_host` commands so registry state and symlinks stay consistent.

Maru can bootstrap this bundle's shared runtime into its runtime root:

```bash
envs/default/setup.sh --target ~/.maru/env --dry-run
envs/default/setup.sh --target ~/.maru/env
```

## Runtime Values

Skill packages must not contain personal IDs, secrets, or workspace-only values. Runtime values belong in the caller's workspace configuration, usually `workspace.config.yaml`.

Vault-facing skills discover vault paths, project registry paths, and log paths from workspace config and use Obsidian MCP for vault markdown. See `lib/vault_adapter.md`.

## Contributing

Keep bundled skills self-contained and reusable. Do not add private identities,
real credentials, institution-specific internal details, or local absolute paths
to T1 packages.
